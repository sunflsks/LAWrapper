libarchive is the *de-facto* archive library, supporting a plethora of formats while being able to do many different things. However, it is written in C, which makes it nonconducive to many people. This library intends to make it easier for people to integrate libarchive in their own projects.

#### As of right now, this is nowhere near feature complete. However, I intend on making it usable sometime soon.

Please note that you'll need libarchive.a added to your xcode project for this to work. I've added a script in here that makes it easy to create a static libarchive (for macos at least, it'll probably need modification for iOS)
